        Bee and PuppyCat is an American animated web series created and written
        by Natasha Allegri and directed by Larry Leichliter. The series revolves
        around Bee (voiced by Allyn Rachel), an unemployed woman in her early
        twenties, who encounters a mysterious creature named PuppyCat (voiced by
        the Vocaloid program Oliver).

        She adopts this apparent cat-dog hybrid, and together they go on a
        series of temporary jobs to pay off her monthly rent. These bizarre jobs
        take the duo across strange worlds out in space. The show is produced by
        Frederator Studios and is animated by Dong Woo Animation in South Korea
        and OLM, Inc. in Japan.
